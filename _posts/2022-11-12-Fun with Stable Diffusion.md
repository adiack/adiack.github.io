title:  "Generating images with Keras Stable Diffusion [TPU]"

# Stable Difussion fun with the small and infinitely big worlds

In order to generate the iamge below I used the Keras implementation with TPU.
This colab which only has a dozen lines of code allowed me to evaluate the performance of generating images on TPUs with the KerasCV implementation of ![stability](https://stability.ai).ai's text-to-image model, ![Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
