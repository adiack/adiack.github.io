# Navigating the AI Revolution in Education

This morning, I was discussing with my colleagues the issue of banning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education as a way to prevent cheating.

Last week, one of the biggest AI research conferences also banned the use of AI models to write scientific papers, raising the question of whether other sectors, like education, should also be considering a ban.

In my opinion, this is ultimately a losing battle. Students are resourceful and will find alternative ways to access AI, even if behind paywalls or geographic restrictions. I predict that by the end of the year, almost everyone will be using AI to increase productivity while studying or working, either directly or indirectly via apps and services. Rather than trying to stop the use of AI, educators and students should prioritize understanding how it works, its limitations, and the risks involved in using it.

AI models are trained on existing internet data and can reproduce offensive biases found in that data, as well as struggle to provide accurate responses in low resource languages commonly used in Africa. Additionally, it is important to understand that these models do not actually "understand" the content of the queries they are asked - they simply provide the most statistically likely correct response based on their training data. This can lead to models producing nonsensical or "hallucinated" responses, and in some cases, they may even be able to produce written responses in a very convincing style, leading to potential embarrassing situations for students who are caught using them.

In the workplace, the use of AI to improve productivity is also likely to become more widespread. Why wouldn't someone use AI if it allows them to finish a proposal in 10 minutes instead of an hour or correct assignments 10 times faster? While this may bring benefits, it also raises ethical and cyber-security concerns. For example, as a startup, do you really want your employees discussing company intellectual property with random AI bots on the internet? To address these concerns, it may be necessary for companies to develop their own internal AI tools for use on private networks.

Ultimately, it is important that we approach the integration of AI in education and the workplace with a clear understanding of its capabilities and limitations, and take appropriate steps to ensure effective and responsible use.
