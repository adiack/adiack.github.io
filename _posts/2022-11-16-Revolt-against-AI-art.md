# Diffusion models and art: should AI-generated content be banned from marketplaces? 

Copyright law does not protect the style of art, but is it ethical to sell art generated by diffusion models? 

Formfunction, a Solana NFT marketplace, started banning content from diffusion models back in May 2022 (Midjourney, artbreeder, disco diffusion, etc.). 

This was the first AI ban that I'm aware of. Formfunction did not consider such generative work to be original. They only considered the use of AI models only if the artist trained it with their own artwork. 

In my opinion, the use of AI to generate content should always be disclosed, and it should include documentation on the data sets used for training.
