#  What does it mean to write with AI?

The Wordcraft Writers Workshop is a collaboration between Google's PAIR and Magenta teams, and 13 professional writers from a diverse set of creative writing backgrounds. Together we explore the limits of co-writing with LaMDA and foster an honest and earnest conversation about the rapidly changing relationship between technology and creativity.

Why this is important: Experts predict that language models will soon be widely used in the creative industry. This workshop is important because it provides a space for the community to dialog about the usage and impact of this technology.
