# AI 4 CODE

* Music Pop star embrace Generative AI and splitting revenue showing how the industry is going to be impacted by generative AI. 
    *  “50% royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice. Same deal as I would with any artist i collab with. Feel free to use my voice without penalty. I have no label and no legal bindings.”

# AI 4 Music and Audio 

* Google Research releases Sandstrom, a model for audio generation, it can quickly generate large amounts of audio in a short time using a TPU. It can generate high quality natural dialogue, longer audio sequences that sound natural and realistic.

# AI 4 Text and conversation 

* AI in your browser even when offline! I tested an LMM powered by WebGPU on my MacBook M1 with the Chrome Canary. The demo uses Google's FLAN large language models and it also works on my pixel phone. Personally, the potential for this tech is huge for LMICs where internet connectivity is sometimes challenging.
