# Speak, Read and Prompt

SPEAR-TTS is a multi-speaker TTS that can be trained with only 15min of single-speaker parallel data. It synthesises high-quality speech & can generalise zero-shot to a new voice using only a 3s sample.

The work show high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) that requires very limited supervision can be an important step towards enabling TTS technology for communities that are underserved by TTS solutions due to speaking "low-resource" languages. This can also enable producing speech in accents and dialects that are currently uncovered by existing TTS systems. However, the authors acknowledge that the ability to mimic a voice can have malicious applications, and therefore, it is crucial to put safeguards against the misuse of their TTS system. They suggest that one approach could be to detect synthesized speech using classifiers or audio watermarking in the future.
