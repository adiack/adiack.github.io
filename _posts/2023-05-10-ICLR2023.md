# ICLR@ Kigali

The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2023 was held in Kigali, Rwanda from May 1-5. This was the first time that the conference had been held in Africa, and it was a great success.
I was fortunate enough to attend the conference, and I was very impressed by the level of research and the diversity of the participants. The conference was a great opportunity to learn about the latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to network with researchers from around the world.
In addition to the technical sessions, there were also a number of social events. Cohere and Africa NLP socials were a lot of fun. The organizers of ICLR 2023 really put together a great conference showing it is possible to do it from Africa.
