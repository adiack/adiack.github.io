# AI 4 CODE

In mid February Replit is announced the launch of Ghostwriter Chat, a conversational AI integrated in its IDE. According tot Replit Its platform aims to help developers generate, debug, refactor, and understand code faster than ever before. 

Update: Replit [announces](https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2023-03-28-Replit-and-Google-Cloud-Partner-to-Advance-Generative-AI-for-Software-Development) a partnership with Google Cloud.

Replit's [Ghostwriter](https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter) ChatBot is already an impressive tool for code generation, and this new collaboration with Google Cloud's AI infrastructure is promising for the future of AI-powered development tools.While AI code copilots are amazing assets for coders, it is important to note in my opinion, that they cannot replace the guidance and expertise of experienced senior programmers who can oversee projects from start to finish. However, the assistance provided by AI code copilots is still significant and will transform the coding ecosystem. It will be interesting to see how this technology develops in the future and how it adapts to other languages.
