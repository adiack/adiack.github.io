#  multi-modality, multi-tasking, and multi-embodiment generalist policying with Gato

Deepmind releases Gatoüêàa scalable generalist agent that uses a single transformer with exactly the same weights to play Atari, follow text instructions, caption images, chat with people, control a real robot arm.

Why this is important: The model can do a lot of things, including playing video games, captioning images, and talking to people. Deepmind‚Äôs previous model AlphaZero could only learn one task at a time whereas Gato learns multiple different tasks at the same time and can switch between them without having to forget one skill before learning another. But relax we're not talking about AGI here.
