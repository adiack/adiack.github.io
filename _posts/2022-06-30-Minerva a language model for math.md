# Quantitative reasoning by language models

Researchers announce Minerva, a language model capable of solving mathematical questions using step-by-step natural language reasoning.

Minerva was trained on a large dataset made of webpages with mathematical content and scientific papers. 

Havign general models capable of solving quantitative reasoning problems shows exciting potential for education.
