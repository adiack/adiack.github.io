# Scaling Vision Transformers to 22 Billion Parameters

ViT-22B is a new vision backbone that is the largest reported to date. This has important implications for scaling machine learning models and improving their capabilities. 

According to the author, VIT-22b is highly efficient, offers an improved tradeoff between fairness and performance, and demonstrates improved generalization to out-of-distribution tasks in image recognition. ViT22B shows an improved tradeoff between fairness and performance.
