# The EU AI Act and its Implications

In April 2021, the European Commission introduced the [AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), a proposed law that aims to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology within the European Union. The AI Act divides applications of AI into three categories based on their level of risk: prohibited applications, high-risk applications that are subject to specific legal requirements, and applications that are not explicitly banned or listed as high-risk, which are not to be regulated.

The implementation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016 had a significant impact on the rest of the world, with many countries adopting GDPR-like standards for data privacy. In Africa and Asia, 61% and 57% of countries respectively have implemented data protection regulations based on the GDPR, according to UNCTAD. However, the enforcement of data regulation laws in Africa is still a developing area.

It is likely that African countries will create AI legislation that reflects the risks that the technology poses to their populations, while also aligning with their national interests and taking into account the unique economic and social contexts of the continent. This legislation may also be influenced by the structure of the AI Act of the European Union.

One potential challenge for African countries in crafting AI regulation laws similar to the AI Act will be identifying and categorizing the risks associated with using AI in Africa, as well as obtaining the necessary resources and expertise to draft and enforce such legislation. In addition, these countries will need to consider how to create regulations that do not stifle the growth of AI technology for development.

Under the AI Act of the European Union, high-risk applications of AI include systems that use automated decision-making combined with the processing of sensitive personal data, the tracking of natural persons, CV-scanning tools that rank job applicants, biometric identification tools, and social scoring systems. In Africa, the temptation to use AI for security and surveillance may be strong, potentially leading some countries to use AI for similar purposes as China. On the other hand, AI identification tools could provide development opportunities in less digitally-developed countries by allowing services to be delivered to larger populations.

Companies that have already prioritized GDPR compliance will likely be better prepared for AI regulation, as they have already gained experience with data privacy compliance. This experience with the GDPR will help them understand the implications of similar regulations when it comes to AI.

The AI Act of the European Union may also prompt other countries to adopt GDPR-like regulations in order to be better prepared for AI regulation. Alternatively, countries may choose to develop a national AI adoption strategy first, in order to enhance the potential benefits of AI and address any potential negative consequences.

Overall, the AI Act of the European Union will have significant implications for African countries as they consider how to regulate AI technology. It is important for these countries to carefully consider the risks and benefits of AI and to create regulations that are tailored to their unique contexts while also taking into account international best practices.
