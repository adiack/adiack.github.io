# Advancements in AI and ML Research in January 2023: Health, Generative AI, and Music

January 2023 stands out to me as a milestone in AI and ML. In a short time, I have seen exciting advancements in the AI and ML research I have been familiar with being applied in various fields. The past month has seen the emergence of new studies, AI playgrounds, and startups focused on language models, voice and sound technology, music, and other aspects of generative AI. Additionally, the availability of AI services through APIs has enabled startups and independent developers to create products that make use of AI in decision-making, media-generation, and advice-giving. For example, customer service by AI will be a trend to observe this year. These advancements below are among the most interesting to me, personally. There are still pertinent issues that need to be addressed, such as algorithmic biases against certain groups. I am eager to see the development of responsible AI research and UX/UI studies to guide us through these uncertain times. **Please note that this post is my own perspective not the views of my employer**.

### Health and AI

Alphafold has been freely available for 18 months  and according to DeepMind 1M+ researchers have now made use of it in their vital work. From antibiotic resistance to crop sustainability, you can read some of the stories [here](https://unfolded.deepmind.com/#stories "here")

#### Salesforce Research releases Progen

“ProGen is an AI language model that generates new artificial proteins, which function as well as natural proteins. ProGen applies AI successes in language modeling to protein generation, learning rules for generating amino acid sequences in a structurally and functionally viable manner, designing proteins you can actually make in a lab that have useful properties (for example, new antibacterial proteins that don't exist in nature).”

#### BioNTech Group buys Instadeep for £342M in cash + up to £200M more.

Although this is great news for the AI startups in Africa, this strategic acquisition is mainly about BioTech securing AI and ML expertise. This deal will allow BioNTech to apply AI and ML technology to develop novel drugs and treatments and expand their global research and talent networks.

We've seen recently a few biotech companies going into partnership with the AI/ML industry and academics, below are some examples:

### Generative AI

ChatGPT ChatGPT ChatGPT, in case you have not heard yet.

ChatGPT is ushering in a new era of creativity and awareness around the capabilities of AI. By making AI and language models more accessible to people everywhere, from Uber drivers to high school students, ChatGPT showcasing to many people for the first time the power of AI applications.

We can expect a plethora of powerful ChatBots this year that can specialize in different tasks. 

#### AI generated music using text.

Music and AI started 2023 with a blast, several noteworthy papers and playgrounds have been release in January.  This is a space I have been watching over the years namely starting with Project Magenta. While the quality of the produced sound is improving, we are far from clear lyrics. These models have the potential to unlock creativity for many, but will most likely be met with legal and ethical controversies. On the plus side, there is potential for discovering new and unique music through AI.

**Google Research Releases MusicLM**, a model capable of generating high-fidelity music from text descriptions. The paper includes MusicCaps, a public dataset providing 5k music-text pairs with expert-written descriptions.

**AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models**

AudioLDM generates text-conditional sound effects, human speech, and music (By University of Surrey, and Imperial College London)

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12503

**Moûsai: Text-to-Music Generation with Long-Context Latent Diffusion. 
**
A cascading latent diffusion approach that can generate multiple minutes of high-quality stereo music at 48kHz from textual descriptions.

**CVPR to include AI art demos
**
CVPR's [Demos session](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/Conferences/2023/CallForDemos "Demos session") is broadening to include an "Art Gallery" for AI-powered or generative media (diffusion, NeRF, AR, anything)


**Getty Images is suing Stability AI, creators of Stable Diffusion**. The stock photo site claims Stable Diffusion "unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright" and has "commenced legal proceedings" in London.

Definitely a [case](https://t.co/DXuns6maGs "case") to watch, this is unchartered territory for copyright litigation to my knowledge.



#### Customer Service and AI

I expect this to be a major trend in 2023, as language models are getting better this opens the door to automate a lot of customer service tasks. (Banks, Utilities, Telcos, Embassies, etc… are likely to embrace LLM for customer service)  

Early in 2023, Intercom [announced](https://www.intercom.com/blog/announcing-new-intercom-ai-features/ "announced") its integration of ChatGPT for summarisation and generative features such as expanding text and rephrasing customer answers. 

“A support rep can simply click the‘Summarize’button to generate a detailed TL;DR of an entire customer conversation”

Director of Machine Learning, Fergal Reid, who believes this is a“sputnik moment".

#### Mind blown section

Its NeRF Birthday! [[Original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934.pdf "Original paper")]

NeRF is 3 years old and today people come up with mind blowing videos.

#### Neural Cellular Automata

Self organized organism research does not get enough attention in my opinion, I’m totally mind blown by what people are able to similate. 

In late december last year“Particle Lenia and the energy-based formulation”was release by @eyvindn @RandazzoEttore and @zzznah

#### LLM for papers

Abacus.ai releases [ExplainPaper](http://explainpaper.com). It uses AI to summarize and explain things. Another amazing use of Large Language Models. AI explaining AI!

Accurate Pose Estimation Via WiFi Signals "our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input" arxiv: 

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250)

#### ICML bans ChatGPT

"Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless these produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis."
