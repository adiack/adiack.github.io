# is it ethical to sell AI "art"? 

Copyright law does not protect style of art, however is it ethical to sell art generated by diffusion models and is it even art to begin with.
The definition of art is subjective however todays's definition do not include machines who have learned from human art.

Formfunction a Solana NFT marketplace started to ban content from diffusion models back in may 2022 (Midjourney, artbreeder, disco diffusion, ect..).
It was the first AI ban to my knowledge, the reason, Formfunction did not consider such generative work as original.
They only considered the use of AI models if the artist trained it with their own artwork.
