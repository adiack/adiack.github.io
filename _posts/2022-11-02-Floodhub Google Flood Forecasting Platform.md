#  Google's flood forecasting platform expands to Africa

Google's flood forecasting platform is now live.
In 2021 115 million people were alerted using Google Forecasting platform, mostly in South Asia. 
Google is now expanding coverage to Africa and I am thirlled to see this happen in the context of dramatic floods in 2022 all over West Africa. 

Why this is important: Floods claim thousands of lives every year. We use satellite imagery and AI to accurately map rivers, model what areas will be flooded, and send timely info
